# N-Body Simulation

A basic n-body simulation explorer to help learn C, Raylib, and the RK4 iterative method, and to play around with the weirdness of Newtonian gravity!

## Running
To run (on macOS anyway):

```bash
brew install raylib pkg-config
git clone https://github.com/seabass-space/n-body
cd n-body
make run
```

For other platforms, the only external dependency is [Raylib](https://www.raylib.com/), so follow build instructions on the [wiki](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/wiki).
